## 🌟 Overview

Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsport, where drivers, teams, and countries compete for supremacy. This project analyzes historical F1 data to answer questions like:

- Which countries dominate Formula 1, and why?
- How do driver performances vary across years and circuits?
- What makes drivers like Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher stand out?

Through a combination of Python programming, statistical tests, and visualization techniques, we uncover the hidden stories behind the data.
